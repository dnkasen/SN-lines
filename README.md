SN-lines
========

Code for line ID

* snlines.py

The main code. Run it like./snlines.py <filename>, where <filename> is a 2 column (wavelength, intensity) text file.

* pickledata.py

This transforms a text file of line information like kurucz_cd23_cut.dat into a python dict object that the main code uses.
